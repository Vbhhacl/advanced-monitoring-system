# 📡 Anomaly Detection Monitoring System

A lightweight, ML-powered monitoring tool that detects anomalies in real-time data and exposes metrics for observability tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## 🚀 Overview
This project combines:

- ✅ A trained **Isolation Forest** ML model
- 🌐 A **Flask API** to serve predictions
- 📈 A **Prometheus metrics exporter**
- ⚙️ A scalable architecture that can be connected to real sensors

  💡 Why This Project Matters
🧠 Machine Learning: Real use of Isolation Forest for anomaly detection

🔌 Observability: Integrates with monitoring systems

⚙️ Scalable: Can evolve to include live sensor feeds and dashboards

📊 Production-ready structure: Easy to connect with Grafana, Docker, or cloud

📈 Future Ideas
🔌 Connect to real IoT sensors

📊 Integrate with Grafana

🐳 Add Docker for containerized deployment

🔐 Add logging & authentication
